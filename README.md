#Sarah's Angels Adoption Tool

This is an all-emcompassing tool for potential pet adopters. The site is built using data form the PetFinder API and has an interactive map, regional search functionality, and a live Tableau Dashboard. The "Breed Detector" folder has a machine learning ensemble that will indentify photos of Dogs vs. Cats, and then print their breed.
